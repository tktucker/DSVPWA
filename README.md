# Damn Simple Vulnerable Python Web Application

**DSVPWA** is a simple web application written in Python and mainly inspired by [DSVW](https://github.com/stamparm/DSVW). It is deliberately vulnerable for educational purposes to demonstrate some of the [OWASP TOP Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) security risks and other vulnerabilities. It supposed to be used locally in a virtual machine or in a Docker container.

## Features

In comparison to other similar projects, this application also provides very basic *session management* and *HTML templating*. Currently it can be used to demonstrate the following security attacks and vulnerabilities:
+ [Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)
+ [Command injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection)
+ [Deserialization of untrusted data](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data)
+ [Execution after redirect (EAR)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Execution_After_Redirect_(EAR))
+ [Insecure transport](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Insecure_Transport)
+ [Open redirect](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html)
+ [Path traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)
+ [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss)
+ [Session fixation](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation)
+ [Session hijacking](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_hijacking_attack)
+ [SQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)
+ [Clickjacking](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking)

## Requirements

The project's goal is to be simple, hence the only requirement is [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Note that some attacks or vulnerabilities might have additional requirements. However, most of the features should be still available on minimal configurations.

## Usage

### Standalone

You can simply run the standalone application with:

    > python dsvpwa.py

### Docker

You can build and run the application with an interactive shell (`-it`) in a container that is automatically removed (`--rm`) and bind the container's default port to the host (`-p`):

    > docker build -t dsvpwa .
    > docker run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:65413:65413 dsvpwa

Note that ports which are not bound to the host (i.e., `-p 65413:65413` instead of `-p 127.0.0.1:65413:65413`) will be accessible from the outside.
